Design Patterns is the most essential part of Software Engineering, as they provide the general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. They usually represent some of the best practices adopted by experienced object-oriented software developers. We can not consider the Design Patterns as the finished design that can be directly converted into code. They are only templates that describe how to solve a particular problem with great efficiency.

## Creational Design Patterns
Creational patterns provides essential information regarding the Class instantiation or the object instantiation. Class Creational Pattern and the Object Creational pattern is the major categorization of the Creational Design Patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

### Factory Method 
* What is this pattern about?
A Factory is an object for creating other objects.

* What does this example do?
The code shows a way to localize words in two languages: English and
Greek. `get_localizer` is the factory function that constructs a
localizer depending on the language chosen. The localizer object will
be an instance from a different class according to the language
localized. However, the main code does not have to worry about which
localizer will be instantiated, since the method `localize` will be called
in the same way independently of the language.

* Where can the pattern be used practically?
The Factory Method can be seen in the popular web framework Django:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/forms/formsets/
For example, different types of forms are created using a formset_factory

* TL;DR
**Creates objects without having to specify the exact class.**

```python
from typing import Dict
from typing import Protocol
from typing import Type


class Localizer(Protocol):
    def localize(self, msg: str) -> str:
        pass


class GreekLocalizer:
    """A simple localizer a la gettext"""

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.translations = {"dog": "σκύλος", "cat": "γάτα"}

    def localize(self, msg: str) -> str:
        """We'll punt if we don't have a translation"""
        return self.translations.get(msg, msg)


class EnglishLocalizer:
    """Simply echoes the message"""

    def localize(self, msg: str) -> str:
        return msg


def get_localizer(language: str = "English") -> Localizer:

    """Factory"""
    localizers: Dict[str, Type[Localizer]] = {
        "English": EnglishLocalizer,
        "Greek": GreekLocalizer,
    }

    return localizers[language]()


def main():
    """
    # Create our localizers
    >>> e, g = get_localizer(language="English"), get_localizer(language="Greek")

    # Localize some text
    >>> for msg in "dog parrot cat bear".split():
    ...     print(e.localize(msg), g.localize(msg))
    dog σκύλος
    parrot parrot
    cat γάτα
    bear bear
    """


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest

    doctest.testmod()
```

### Abstract Factory Method 
* What is this pattern about?

    In Java and other languages, the Abstract Factory Pattern serves to provide an interface for
    creating related/dependent objects without need to specify their
    actual class.

    The idea is to abstract the creation of objects depending on business
    logic, platform choice, etc.

    In Python, the interface we use is simply a callable, which is "builtin" interface
    in Python, and in normal circumstances we can simply use the class itself as
    that callable, because classes are first class objects in Python.

* What does this example do?
This particular implementation abstracts the creation of a pet and
does so depending on the factory we chose (Dog or Cat, or random_animal)
This works because both Dog/Cat and random_animal respect a common
interface (callable for creation and .speak()).
Now my application can create pets abstractly and decide later,
based on my own criteria, dogs over cats.

* TL;DR
**Provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories.**

```python
import random
from typing import Type


class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name = name

    def speak(self) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError


class Dog(Pet):
    def speak(self) -> None:
        print("woof")

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f"Dog<{self.name}>"


class Cat(Pet):
    def speak(self) -> None:
        print("meow")

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f"Cat<{self.name}>"


class PetShop:

    """A pet shop"""

    def __init__(self, animal_factory: Type[Pet]) -> None:
        """pet_factory is our abstract factory.  We can set it at will."""

        self.pet_factory = animal_factory

    def buy_pet(self, name: str) -> Pet:
        """Creates and shows a pet using the abstract factory"""

        pet = self.pet_factory(name)
        print(f"Here is your lovely {pet}")
        return pet


# Additional factories:

# Create a random animal
def random_animal(name: str) -> Pet:
    """Let's be dynamic!"""
    return random.choice([Dog, Cat])(name)


# Show pets with various factories
def main() -> None:
    """
    # A Shop that sells only cats
    >>> cat_shop = PetShop(Cat)
    >>> pet = cat_shop.buy_pet("Lucy")
    Here is your lovely Cat<Lucy>
    >>> pet.speak()
    meow

    # A shop that sells random animals
    >>> shop = PetShop(random_animal)
    >>> for name in ["Max", "Jack", "Buddy"]:
    ...    pet = shop.buy_pet(name)
    ...    pet.speak()
    ...    print("=" * 20)
    Here is your lovely Cat<Max>
    meow
    ====================
    Here is your lovely Dog<Jack>
    woof
    ====================
    Here is your lovely Dog<Buddy>
    woof
    ====================
    """


if __name__ == "__main__":
    random.seed(1234)  # for deterministic doctest outputs
    shop = PetShop(random_animal)
    import doctest

    doctest.testmod()
```

### Builder Method
* What is this pattern about?
It decouples the creation of a complex object and its representation,
so that the same process can be reused to build objects from the same
family.
This is useful when you must separate the specification of an object
from its actual representation (generally for abstraction).

* What does this example do?

    The first example achieves this by using an abstract base
    class for a building, where the initializer (`__init__` method) specifies the
    steps needed, and the concrete subclasses implement these steps.

    In other programming languages, a more complex arrangement is sometimes
    necessary. In particular, you cannot have polymorphic behavior in a constructor in C++.
    Which means this Python technique will not work. The polymorphism
    required has to be provided by an external, already constructed
    instance of a different class.

    In general, in Python this won't be necessary, but a second example showing
    this kind of arrangement is also included.

* TL;DR
**Decouples the creation of a complex object and its representation.**

```python
# Abstract Building
class Building:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.build_floor()
        self.build_size()

    def build_floor(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def build_size(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return "Floor: {0.floor} | Size: {0.size}".format(self)


# Concrete Buildings
class House(Building):
    def build_floor(self) -> None:
        self.floor = "One"

    def build_size(self) -> None:
        self.size = "Big"


class Flat(Building):
    def build_floor(self) -> None:
        self.floor = "More than One"

    def build_size(self) -> None:
        self.size = "Small"


# In some very complex cases, it might be desirable to pull out the building
# logic into another function (or a method on another class), rather than being
# in the base class '__init__'. (This leaves you in the strange situation where
# a concrete class does not have a useful constructor)


class ComplexBuilding:
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return "Floor: {0.floor} | Size: {0.size}".format(self)


class ComplexHouse(ComplexBuilding):
    def build_floor(self) -> None:
        self.floor = "One"

    def build_size(self) -> None:
        self.size = "Big and fancy"


def construct_building(cls) -> Building:
    building = cls()
    building.build_floor()
    building.build_size()
    return building


def main():
    """
    >>> house = House()
    >>> house
    Floor: One | Size: Big

    >>> flat = Flat()
    >>> flat
    Floor: More than One | Size: Small

    # Using an external constructor function:
    >>> complex_house = construct_building(ComplexHouse)
    >>> complex_house
    Floor: One | Size: Big and fancy
    """


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest

    doctest.testmod()
```

### Prototype
* What is this pattern about?
This patterns aims to reduce the number of classes required by an
application. Instead of relying on subclasses it creates objects by
copying a prototypical instance at run-time.

    This is useful as it makes it easier to derive new kinds of objects,
    when instances of the class have only a few different combinations of
    state, and when instantiation is expensive.

* What does this example do?
When the number of prototypes in an application can vary, it can be
useful to keep a Dispatcher (aka, Registry or Manager). This allows
clients to query the Dispatcher for a prototype before cloning a new
instance.

    Below provides an example of such Dispatcher, which contains three
    copies of the prototype: `default`, `objecta` and `objectb`.

*TL;DR
**Creates new object instances by cloning prototype.**

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import Any


class Prototype:
    def __init__(self, value: str = "default", **attrs: Any) -> None:
        self.value = value
        self.__dict__.update(attrs)

    def clone(self, **attrs: Any) -> Prototype:
        """Clone a prototype and update inner attributes dictionary"""
        # Python in Practice, Mark Summerfield
        # copy.deepcopy can be used instead of next line.
        obj = self.__class__(**self.__dict__)
        obj.__dict__.update(attrs)
        return obj


class PrototypeDispatcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self._objects = {}

    def get_objects(self) -> dict[str, Prototype]:
        """Get all objects"""
        return self._objects

    def register_object(self, name: str, obj: Prototype) -> None:
        """Register an object"""
        self._objects[name] = obj

    def unregister_object(self, name: str) -> None:
        """Unregister an object"""
        del self._objects[name]


def main() -> None:
    """
    >>> dispatcher = PrototypeDispatcher()
    >>> prototype = Prototype()

    >>> d = prototype.clone()
    >>> a = prototype.clone(value='a-value', category='a')
    >>> b = a.clone(value='b-value', is_checked=True)
    >>> dispatcher.register_object('objecta', a)
    >>> dispatcher.register_object('objectb', b)
    >>> dispatcher.register_object('default', d)

    >>> [{n: p.value} for n, p in dispatcher.get_objects().items()]
    [{'objecta': 'a-value'}, {'objectb': 'b-value'}, {'default': 'default'}]

    >>> print(b.category, b.is_checked)
    a True
    """

    import doctest

### Singleton 
"""
* What is this pattern about?
The Borg pattern (also known as the Monostate pattern) is a way to
implement singleton behavior, but instead of having only one instance
of a class, there are multiple instances that share the same state. In
other words, the focus is on sharing state instead of sharing instance
identity.

* What does this example do?
To understand the implementation of this pattern in Python, it is
important to know that, in Python, instance attributes are stored in a
attribute dictionary called `__dict__`. Usually, each instance will have
its own dictionary, but the Borg pattern modifies this so that all
instances have the same dictionary.
In this example, the `__shared_state` attribute will be the dictionary
shared between all instances, and this is ensured by assigning
`__shared_state` to the `__dict__` variable when initializing a new
instance (i.e., in the `__init__` method). Other attributes are usually
added to the instance's attribute dictionary, but, since the attribute
dictionary itself is shared (which is `__shared_state`), all other
attributes will also be shared.

* Where is the pattern used practically?
Sharing state is useful in applications like managing database connections:
https://github.com/onetwopunch/pythonDbTemplate/blob/master/database.py

* TL;DR
**Provides singleton-like behavior sharing state between instances.**

```python
from typing import Dict


class Borg:
    _shared_state: Dict[str, str] = {}

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.__dict__ = self._shared_state


class YourBorg(Borg):
    def __init__(self, state: str = None) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        if state:
            self.state = state
        else:
            # initiate the first instance with default state
            if not hasattr(self, "state"):
                self.state = "Init"

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return self.state


def main():
    """
    >>> rm1 = YourBorg()
    >>> rm2 = YourBorg()

    >>> rm1.state = 'Idle'
    >>> rm2.state = 'Running'

    >>> print('rm1: {0}'.format(rm1))
    rm1: Running
    >>> print('rm2: {0}'.format(rm2))
    rm2: Running

    # When the `state` attribute is modified from instance `rm2`,
    # the value of `state` in instance `rm1` also changes
    >>> rm2.state = 'Zombie'

    >>> print('rm1: {0}'.format(rm1))
    rm1: Zombie
    >>> print('rm2: {0}'.format(rm2))
    rm2: Zombie

    # Even though `rm1` and `rm2` share attributes, the instances are not the same
    >>> rm1 is rm2
    False

    # New instances also get the same shared state
    >>> rm3 = YourBorg()

    >>> print('rm1: {0}'.format(rm1))
    rm1: Zombie

    >>> rm4 = YourBorg('Running')

    >>> print('rm4: {0}'.format(rm4))

    rm3: Running
    """

### Object Pool
* What is this pattern about?
This pattern is used when creating an object is costly (and they are
created frequently) but only a few are used at a time. With a Pool we
can manage those instances we have as of now by caching them. Now it
is possible to skip the costly creation of an object if one is
available in the pool.
A pool allows to 'check out' an inactive object and then to return it.
If none are available the pool creates one to provide without wait.

* What does this example do?
In this example queue.Queue is used to create the pool (wrapped in a
custom ObjectPool object to use with the with statement), and it is
populated with strings.
As we can see, the first string object put in "yam" is USED by the
with statement. But because it is released back into the pool
afterwards it is reused by the explicit call to sample_queue.get().
Same thing happens with "sam", when the ObjectPool created inside the
function is deleted (by the GC) and the object is returned.

*TL;DR
**Stores a set of initialized objects kept ready to use.**

```python
class ObjectPool:
    def __init__(self, queue, auto_get=False):
        self._queue = queue
        self.item = self._queue.get() if auto_get else None

    def __enter__(self):
        if self.item is None:
            self.item = self._queue.get()
        return self.item

    def __exit__(self, Type, value, traceback):
        if self.item is not None:
            self._queue.put(self.item)
            self.item = None

    def __del__(self):
        if self.item is not None:
            self._queue.put(self.item)
            self.item = None


def main():
    """
    >>> import queue

    >>> def test_object(queue):
    ...    pool = ObjectPool(queue, True)
    ...    print('Inside func: {}'.format(pool.item))

    >>> sample_queue = queue.Queue()

    >>> sample_queue.put('yam')
    >>> with ObjectPool(sample_queue) as obj:
    ...    print('Inside with: {}'.format(obj))
    Inside with: yam

    >>> print('Outside with: {}'.format(sample_queue.get()))
    Outside with: yam

    >>> sample_queue.put('sam')
    >>> test_object(sample_queue)
    Inside func: sam

    >>> print('Outside func: {}'.format(sample_queue.get()))
    Outside func: sam

### Lazy Evaluation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation

* TL;DR

import functools


class lazy_property:
    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function
        functools.update_wrapper(self, function)

        if obj is None:
            return self
        val = self.function(obj)
        obj.__dict__[self.function.__name__] = val
        return val


def lazy_property2(fn):

## Structural Design Patterns
Structural design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Mostly they use Inheritance to compose all the interfaces. It also identifies the relationships which led to the simplification of the structure.

### Adapter
* What is this pattern about?
The Adapter pattern provides a different interface for a class. We can
think about it as a cable adapter that allows you to charge a phone
somewhere that has outlets in a different shape. Following this idea,
the Adapter pattern is useful to integrate classes that couldn't be
integrated due to their incompatible interfaces.

* What does this example do?

    The example has classes that represent entities (Dog, Cat, Human, Car)
    that make different noises. The Adapter class provides a different
    interface to the original methods that make such noises. So the
    original interfaces (e.g., bark and meow) are available under a
    different name: make_noise.

* Where is the pattern used practically?
The Grok framework uses adapters to make objects work with a
particular API without modifying the objects themselves:
http://grok.zope.org/doc/current/grok_overview.html#adapters

* TL;DR
**Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.**

```python
from typing import Callable, TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")


class Dog:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.name = "Dog"

    def bark(self) -> str:
        return "woof!"


class Cat:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.name = "Cat"

    def meow(self) -> str:
        return "meow!"


class Human:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.name = "Human"

    def speak(self) -> str:
        return "'hello'"


class Car:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.name = "Car"

    def make_noise(self, octane_level: int) -> str:
        return f"vroom{'!' * octane_level}"


class Adapter:
    """Adapts an object by replacing methods.

### Composite
* What is this pattern about?
The composite pattern describes a group of objects that is treated the
same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of
a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent
part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients
treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

* What does this example do?
The example implements a graphic class，which can be either an ellipse
or a composition of several graphics. Every graphic can be printed.

* Where is the pattern used practically?
In graphics editors a shape can be basic or complex. An example of a
simple shape is a line, where a complex shape is a rectangle which is
made of four line objects. Since shapes have many operations in common
such as rendering the shape to screen, and since shapes follow a
part-whole hierarchy, composite pattern can be used to enable the
program to deal with all shapes uniformly.

* TL;DR
**Describes a group of objects that is treated as a single instance.**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List


class Graphic(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def render(self) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError("You should implement this!")


class CompositeGraphic(Graphic):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.graphics: List[Graphic] = []

    def render(self) -> None:
        for graphic in self.graphics:
            graphic.render()

    def add(self, graphic: Graphic) -> None:
        self.graphics.append(graphic)

    def remove(self, graphic: Graphic) -> None:
        self.graphics.remove(graphic)


class Ellipse(Graphic):
    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name = name

    def render(self) -> None:
        print(f"Ellipse: {self.name}")


def main():
    """
    >>> ellipse1 = Ellipse("1")
    >>> ellipse2 = Ellipse("2")
    >>> ellipse3 = Ellipse("3")
    >>> ellipse4 = Ellipse("4")

    >>> graphic1 = CompositeGraphic()
    >>> graphic2 = CompositeGraphic()

    >>> graphic1.add(ellipse1)
    >>> graphic1.add(ellipse2)
    >>> graphic1.add(ellipse3)
    >>> graphic2.add(ellipse4)

    >>> graphic = CompositeGraphic()

    >>> graphic.add(graphic1)
    >>> graphic.add(graphic2)

    >>> graphic.render()

    Ellipse: 4

### Decorator
* What is this pattern about?
The Decorator pattern is used to dynamically add a new feature to an
object without changing its implementation. It differs from
inheritance because the new feature is added only to that particular
object, not to the entire subclass.

* What does this example do?
This example shows a way to add formatting options (boldface and
italic) to a text by appending the corresponding tags (`<b>` and
`<i>`). Also, we can see that decorators can be applied one after the other,
since the original text is passed to the bold wrapper, which in turn
is passed to the italic wrapper.

* Where is the pattern used practically?
The Grok framework uses decorators to add functionalities to methods,
like permissions or subscription to an event:
http://grok.zope.org/doc/current/reference/decorators.html

* TL;DR
**Adds behaviour to object without affecting its class.**

```python
class TextTag:
    """Represents a base text tag"""

    def __init__(self, text: str) -> None:
        self._text = text

    def render(self) -> str:
        return self._text


class BoldWrapper(TextTag):
    """Wraps a tag in <b>"""

    def __init__(self, wrapped: TextTag) -> None:
        self._wrapped = wrapped

    def render(self) -> str:
        return f"<b>{self._wrapped.render()}</b>"


class ItalicWrapper(TextTag):
    """Wraps a tag in <i>"""

    def __init__(self, wrapped: TextTag) -> None:
        self._wrapped = wrapped

    def render(self) -> str:
        return f"<i>{self._wrapped.render()}</i>"


def main():
    """
    >>> simple_hello = TextTag("hello, world!")
    >>> special_hello = ItalicWrapper(BoldWrapper(simple_hello))

    >>> print("before:", simple_hello.render())
    before: hello, world!

    >>> print("after:", special_hello.render())
    after: <i><b>hello, world!</b></i>
    """

### Facade
* Example from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern#Python

* What is this pattern about?
The Facade pattern is a way to provide a simpler unified interface to
a more complex system. It provides an easier way to access functions
of the underlying system by providing a single entry point.
This kind of abstraction is seen in many real life situations. For
example, we can turn on a computer by just pressing a button, but in
fact there are many procedures and operations done when that happens
(e.g., loading programs from disk to memory). In this case, the button
serves as an unified interface to all the underlying procedures to
turn on a computer.

* Where is the pattern used practically?
This pattern can be seen in the Python standard library when we use
the `isdir` function. Although a user simply uses this function to know
whether a path refers to a directory, the system makes a few
operations and calls other modules (e.g., os.stat) to give the result.

* TL;DR
**Provides a simpler unified interface to a complex system.**

```python
# Complex computer parts
class CPU:
    """
    Simple CPU representation.
    """

    def freeze(self) -> None:
        print("Freezing processor.")

    def jump(self, position: str) -> None:
        print("Jumping to:", position)

    def execute(self) -> None:
        print("Executing.")


class Memory:
    """
    Simple memory representation.
    """

    def load(self, position: str, data: str) -> None:
        print(f"Loading from {position} data: '{data}'.")


class SolidStateDrive:
    """
    Simple solid state drive representation.
    """

    def read(self, lba: str, size: str) -> str:
        return f"Some data from sector {lba} with size {size}"


class ComputerFacade:
    """
    Represents a facade for various computer parts.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.cpu = CPU()

    def start(self):
        self.cpu.freeze()
        self.memory.load("0x00", self.ssd.read("100", "1024"))
        self.cpu.jump("0x00")
        self.cpu.execute()

### Flyweight
* What is this pattern about?
This pattern aims to minimise the number of objects that are needed by
a program at run-time. A Flyweight is an object shared by multiple
contexts, and is indistinguishable from an object that is not shared.

    The state of a Flyweight should not be affected by it's context, this
    is known as its intrinsic state. The decoupling of the objects state
    from the object's context, allows the Flyweight to be shared.

* What does this example do?
The example below sets-up an 'object pool' which stores initialised
objects. When a 'Card' is created it first checks to see if it already
exists instead of creating a new one. This aims to reduce the number of
objects initialised by the program.

* Examples in Python ecosystem:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.intern

* TL;DR
**Minimizes memory usage by sharing data with other similar objects.**

```python
import weakref


class Card:
    """The Flyweight"""

    # Could be a simple dict.
    # With WeakValueDictionary garbage collection can reclaim the object
    # when there are no other references to it.
    _pool: weakref.WeakValueDictionary = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()

    def __new__(cls, value, suit):
        # If the object exists in the pool - just return it
        obj = cls._pool.get(value + suit)
        # otherwise - create new one (and add it to the pool)
        if obj is None:
            obj = object.__new__(Card)
            cls._pool[value + suit] = obj
            # This row does the part we usually see in `__init__`
            obj.value, obj.suit = value, suit
        return obj

    # If you uncomment `__init__` and comment-out `__new__` -
    #   Card becomes normal (non-flyweight).
    # def __init__(self, value, suit):
    #     self.value, self.suit = value, suit

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Card: {self.value}{self.suit}>"


def main():
    """
    >>> c1 = Card('9', 'h')

    >>> c1 is c2

    del cm1

### Proxy 
* What is this pattern about?
Proxy is used in places where you want to add functionality to a class without
changing its interface. The main class is called `Real Subject`. A client should
use the proxy or the real subject without any code change, so both must have the
same interface. Logging and controlling access to the real subject are some of
the proxy pattern usages.

* TL;DR
Add functionality or logic (e.g. logging, caching, authorization) to a resource
without changing its interface.

```python
from typing import Union


class Subject:
    """
    As mentioned in the document, interfaces of both RealSubject and Proxy should
    be the same, because the client should be able to use RealSubject or Proxy with
    no code change.

    Not all times this interface is necessary. The point is the client should be
    able to use RealSubject or Proxy interchangeably with no change in code.
    """

    def do_the_job(self, user: str) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError()


class RealSubject(Subject):

    good example.

## Behavioral Design Pattern
Behavioral patterns are all about identifying the common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

### Chain of Responsibility
* What is this pattern about?

    The Chain of responsibility is an object oriented version of the
    `if ... elif ... elif ... else ...` idiom, with the
    benefit that the condition–action blocks can be dynamically rearranged
    and reconfigured at runtime.

    This pattern aims to decouple the senders of a request from its
    receivers by allowing request to move through chained
    receivers until it is handled.

    Request receiver in simple form keeps a reference to a single successor.
    As a variation some receivers may be capable of sending requests out
    in several directions, forming a `tree of responsibility`.

* TL;DR
Allow a request to pass down a chain of receivers until it is handled.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Optional, Tuple

class Handler(ABC):
    def __init__(self, successor: Optional["Handler"] = None):
        self.successor = successor

    def handle(self, request: int) -> None:
        """
        Handle request and stop.
        If can't - call next handler in chain.

        As an alternative you might even in case of success
        call the next handler.
        """
        res = self.check_range(request)

            self.successor.handle(request)

    def check_range(self, request: int) -> Optional[bool]:

        return None

    doctest.testmod(optionflags=doctest.ELLIPSIS)
```

### Command
* What is this pattern about?
Command pattern decouples the object invoking a job from the one who knows
how to do it. As mentioned in the GoF book, a good example is in menu items.
You have a menu that has lots of items. Each item is responsible for doing a
special thing and you want your menu item just call the execute method when
it is pressed. To achieve this you implement a command object with the execute
method for each menu item and pass to it.

* About the example
We have a menu containing two items. Each item accepts a file name, one hides the file
and the other deletes it. Both items have an undo option.
Each item is a MenuItem class that accepts the corresponding command as input and executes
it's execute method when it is pressed.

* Examples in Python ecosystem:
Django HttpRequest (without execute method):
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/request-response/#httprequest-objects


* TL;DR
**Object oriented implementation of callback functions.**

from typing import List, Union

Implementation of the iterator pattern using the iterator protocol from Python.
Traverses a container and accesses the container's elements.

```python
from __future__ import annotations


class NumberWords:
    """Counts by word numbers, up to a maximum of five"""

    _WORD_MAP = (
        "one",
        "two",

    )

    def __init__(self, start: int, stop: int) -> None:
        self.start = start
        self.stop = stop

    def __iter__(self) -> NumberWords:  # this makes the class an Iterable

### Mediator
https://www.djangospin.com/design-patterns-python/mediator/

Objects in a system communicate through a Mediator instead of directly with each other.
This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby reducing coupling.

* TL;DR
**Encapsulates how a set of objects interact.**

```python

from __future__ import annotations


class ChatRoom:
    """Mediator class"""

    def display_message(self, user: User, message: str) -> None:
        print(f"[{user} says]: {message}")


class User:
    """A class whose instances want to interact with each other"""

    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.chat_room = ChatRoom()

    def say(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.chat_room.display_message(self, message)

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return self.name


def main():
    """
    >>> molly = User('Molly')
    >>> mark = User('Mark')
    >>> ethan = User('Ethan')

    >>> molly.say("Hi Team! Meeting at 3 PM today.")
    [Molly says]: Hi Team! Meeting at 3 PM today.
    >>> mark.say("Roger that!")
    [Mark says]: Roger that!

* Examples in Python ecosystem:
Django Signals: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/signals/
Flask Signals: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/signals/


* TL;DR
Maintains a list of dependents and notifies them of any state changes.

### State Method
Implementation of the state pattern

http://ginstrom.com/scribbles/2007/10/08/design-patterns-python-style/

* TL;DR
Implements state as a derived class of the state pattern interface.
Implements state transitions by invoking methods from the pattern's superclass.

```python
from __future__ import annotations


class State:
    """Base state. This is to share functionality"""

    def scan(self) -> None:
        """Scan the dial to the next station"""
        self.pos += 1
        if self.pos == len(self.stations):
            self.pos = 0
        print(f"Scanning... Station is {self.stations[self.pos]} {self.name}")


class AmState(State):
    def __init__(self, radio: Radio) -> None:
        self.radio = radio
        self.stations = ["1250", "1380", "1510"]
        self.pos = 0
        self.name = "AM"

    def toggle_amfm(self) -> None:
        print("Switching to FM")

    """A radio.     It has a scan button, and an AM/FM toggle switch."""

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """We have an AM state and an FM state"""
        self.amstate = AmState(self)
        self.fmstate = FmState(self)
        self.state = self.amstate

    def toggle_amfm(self) -> None:
        self.state.toggle_amfm()

    def scan(self) -> None:
        self.state.scan()

### Strategy Method
* What is this pattern about?
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

* TL;DR
Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import Callable


class DiscountStrategyValidator:  # Descriptor class for check perform
    @staticmethod
    def validate(obj: Order, value: Callable) -> bool:
        try:
            if obj.price - value(obj) < 0:
                raise ValueError(
                    f"Discount cannot be applied due to negative price resulting. {value.__name__}"
                )
        except ValueError as ex:
            print(str(ex))
            return False
        else:
            return True

    def __set_name__(self, owner, name: str) -> None:
        self.private_name = f"_{name}"

    def __set__(self, obj: Order, value: Callable = None) -> None:
        if value and self.validate(obj, value):
            setattr(obj, self.private_name, value)
        else:
            setattr(obj, self.private_name, None)

    def __get__(self, obj: object, objtype: type = None):
        return getattr(obj, self.private_name)


class Order:
    discount_strategy = DiscountStrategyValidator()

    def __init__(self, price: float, discount_strategy: Callable = None) -> None:

        else:
            discount = 0

        return self.price - discount

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"<Order price: {self.price} with discount strategy: {getattr(self.discount_strategy,'__name__',None)}>"


def ten_percent_discount(order: Order) -> float:
    return order.price * 0.10


def on_sale_discount(order: Order) -> float:
    return order.price * 0.25 + 20


def main():
    """

### Template Method
* Examples in Python ecosystem:
Django class based views: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/class-based-views/


* TL;DR
**Defines the skeleton of a base algorithm, deferring definition of exact
steps to subclasses.**

```python
def get_text() -> str:
    return "plain-text"


def get_pdf() -> str:
    return "pdf"


def get_csv() -> str:
    return "csv"


def convert_to_text(data: str) -> str:
    print("[CONVERT]")
    return f"{data} as text"


def saver() -> None:
    print("[SAVE]")


def template_function(getter, converter=False, to_save=False) -> None:
    data = getter()
    print(f"Got `{data}`")

    if len(data) <= 3 and converter:
        data = converter(data)
    else:
        print("Skip conversion")

    if to_save:
        saver()

    print(f"`{data}` was processed")


def main():
    """
    >>> template_function(get_text, to_save=True)
    Got `plain-text`
    Skip conversion
    [SAVE]
    `plain-text` was processed

    >>> template_function(get_pdf, converter=convert_to_text)
    Got `pdf`
    [CONVERT]
    `pdf as text` was processed

    >>> template_function(get_csv, to_save=True)
    Got `csv`
    Skip conversion
    [SAVE]
    `csv` was processed
    """


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest

    doctest.testmod()
```

### Visitor Method
* http://peter-hoffmann.com/2010/extrinsic-visitor-pattern-python-inheritance.html

* Examples in Python ecosystem:
  - Python's ast.NodeVisitor: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/ast.py#L250
which is then being used e.g. in tools like `pyflakes`.
  - `Black` formatter tool implements it's own: https://github.com/ambv/black/blob/master/black.py#L718

* TL;DR
**Separates an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates.**

```python
class Node:
    pass


class A(Node):
    pass


class B(Node):
    pass


class C(A, B):
    pass


class Visitor:
    def visit(self, node, *args, **kwargs):
        meth = None
        for cls in node.__class__.__mro__:
            meth_name = "visit_" + cls.__name__
            meth = getattr(self, meth_name, None)
            if meth:
                break

        if not meth:
            meth = self.generic_visit
        return meth(node, *args, **kwargs)

    def generic_visit(self, node, *args, **kwargs):
        print("generic_visit " + node.__class__.__name__)

    def visit_B(self, node, *args, **kwargs):
        print("visit_B " + node.__class__.__name__)


def main():
    """
    >>> a, b, c = A(), B(), C()
    >>> visitor = Visitor()

    >>> visitor.visit(a)
