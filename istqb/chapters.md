## Chapter 1

### Why is testing necessary?  

From Section 1.1, you should now be able to explain why testing is necessary  
and support that explanation with examples and evidence. You should be able  
to give examples of negative consequences of a software defect or bug for  
people, companies, and the environment. You should be able to contrast a  
defect with its symptoms. You should be able to discuss the ways in which  
testing fits into and supports higher quality. You should know the glossary terms  
**bug**, **defect**, **error**, **failure**, **fault**, **mistake**, **quality**, **risk**, **software**,  
**testing** and **exhaustive testing**.  

> **defect** - An imperfection or deficiency in a work product where it does not meet its requirements or  
specifications or impairs its intended use.

> **error** - A human action that results in a defect.

> **failure** - An event in which a component or system does not meet its requirements within specified limits.

> **quality** - The degree to which a work product satisfies stated and implied requirements.

> **risk** - A factor that could result in future negative consequences. 

> **testing** - The process within the software development lifecycle that evaluates the quality of a component  
or system and related work products.

> **exhaustive testing** - A test approach in which the test suite comprises all combinations of input values and  
preconditions.

### What is testing?. Testing principles.

From Section 1.2, you should now know what testing is. You should be able  
to remember the common objectives of testing. You should be able to describe  
how testing can find defects, provide confidence and information and prevent  
defects. You should be able to explain the fundamental principles of testing,  
summarized in Section 1.3. You should know the glossary terms **code**, **debugging**,  
**development of software**, **requirement**, **review**, **test basis**,  
**test case**, **testing** and **test objective**.  

### Fundamental test process.

From Section 1.4, you should now recognize the fundamental test process, as  
well as being aware of some other related ways to model the test process. You  
should be able to recall the main testing activities related to test planning and  
control, analysis and design, implementation and execution, evaluating exit criteria and reporting, and test closure.   
You should know the glossary terms **confirmation testing**, **exit criteria**, **incident**, **regression testing**,   
**test basis**, **test condition**, **test coverage**, **test data**, **test execution**, **test log**, **test plan**,  
**test strategy**, **test summary report** and **testware**.

### The psychology of testing.

Finally, from Section 1.5, you now should be able to explain the psychology  
of testing and how people influence testing success. You should recall the  
importance of clear objectives, the right mix of self-testing and independent  
testing and courteous, respectful communication between testers and others on  
the project team, especially about defects. You should be able to explain and  
contrast the mindsets of testers and programmers and why these differences can  
lead to conflicts. You should know the glossary term **independence**  

### Sample exam questions

1. To build confidence in the application.
1. To detect bugs in the application.
1. To gather evidence for a lawsuit.
