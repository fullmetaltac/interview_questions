## Chapter 1

### Why is testing necessary?  

From Section 1.1, you should now be able to explain why testing is necessary  
and support that explanation with examples and evidence. You should be able  
to give examples of negative consequences of a software defect or bug for  
people, companies, and the environment. You should be able to contrast a  
defect with its symptoms. You should be able to discuss the ways in which  
testing fits into and supports higher quality. You should know the glossary terms  
**bug**, **defect**, **error**, **failure**, **fault**, **mistake**, **quality**, **risk**, **software**,  
**testing** and **exhaustive testing**.  

> **defect** - An imperfection or deficiency in a work product where it does not meet its requirements or  
specifications or impairs its intended use.

> **error** - A human action that results in a defect.

> **failure** - An event in which a component or system does not meet its requirements within specified limits.

> **quality** - The degree to which a work product satisfies stated and implied requirements.

> **risk** - A factor that could result in future negative consequences. 

> **testing** - The process within the software development lifecycle that evaluates the quality of a component  
or system and related work products.

> **exhaustive testing** - A test approach in which the test suite comprises all combinations of input values and  
preconditions.

### What is testing?. Testing principles.

From Section 1.2, you should now know what testing is. You should be able  
to remember the common objectives of testing. You should be able to describe  
how testing can find defects, provide confidence and information and prevent  
defects. You should be able to explain the fundamental principles of testing,  
summarized in Section 1.3. You should know the glossary terms **code**, **debugging**,  
**development of software**, **requirement**, **review**, **test basis**,  
**test case**, **testing** and **test objective**.  

> **debugging** - The process of finding, analyzing and removing the causes of failures in a component or system.

> **requirement** - A provision that contains criteria to be fulfilled.

> **review** - A type of static testing in which the quality of a work product or process is evaluated by individuals.

> **test basis** - The body of knowledge used as the basis for test analysis and test design.

> **test case** - A set of preconditions, inputs, actions (where applicable), expected results and postconditions,  
developed based on test conditions.

> **testing** - The process within the software development lifecycle that evaluates the quality of a component or system and related work products.

> **test objective** - The purpose for testing.

### Fundamental test process.

From Section 1.4, you should now recognize the fundamental test process, as  
well as being aware of some other related ways to model the test process. You  
should be able to recall the main testing activities related to test planning and  
control, analysis and design, implementation and execution, evaluating exit criteria and reporting, and test closure.   
You should know the glossary terms **confirmation testing**, **exit criteria**, **incident**, **regression testing**,   
**test basis**, **test condition**, **test coverage**, **test data**, **test execution**, **test log**, **test plan**,  
**test strategy**, **test summary report** and **testware**.

> **confirmation testing** - A type of change-related testing performed after fixing a defect to confirm that a  
failure caused by that defect does not reoccur.

> **exit criteria** - The set of conditions for officially completing a defined task.

> **regression testing** - A type of change-related testing to detect whether defects have been introduced  
or uncovered in unchanged areas of the software.

> **test basis** - The body of knowledge used as the basis for test analysis and test design.

> **test condition** - A testable aspect of a component or system identified as a basis for testing.

> **coverage** - The degree to which specified coverage items are exercised by a test suite, expressed  
as a percentage.

> **test data** - Data needed for test execution.

> **test execution** - The activity that runs a test on a component or system producing actual results.

> **test log** - A chronological record of relevant details about the execution of tests.

> **test plan** - Documentation describing the test objectives to be achieved and the means and the schedule  
for achieving them, organized to coordinate testing activities.

> **test strategy** - A description of how to perform testing to reach test objectives under given circumstances.

> **test completion report** -A type of test report produced at completion milestones that provides an evaluation of  
the corresponding test items against exit criteria.

> **testware** - Work products produced during the test process for use in planning, designing, executing, evaluating  
and reporting on testing.

### The psychology of testing.

Finally, from Section 1.5, you now should be able to explain the psychology  
of testing and how people influence testing success. You should recall the  
importance of clear objectives, the right mix of self-testing and independent  
testing and courteous, respectful communication between testers and others on  
the project team, especially about defects. You should be able to explain and  
contrast the mindsets of testers and programmers and why these differences can  
lead to conflicts. You should know the glossary term **independence**  

> **independence of testing** - Separation of responsibilities, which encourages the accomplishment of  
objective testing.

### SAMPLE EXAM QUESTIONS

1) A company recently purchased a commercial off-the-shelf application to automate  
their bill-paying process. They now plan to run an acceptance test against the package prior to  
putting it into production. Which of the following is their most likely reason for testing?  

1. To build confidence in the application.
1. To detect bugs in the application.
1. To gather evidence for a lawsuit.
1. To train the users
    <details><summary>Answer:</summary>1</details></br>

2) According to the ISTQB Glossary, the word **bug** is synonymous with which of the following words?

1. Incident
1. Defect
1. Mistake
1. Error
    <details><summary>Answer:</summary>2</details></br>

3) According to the ISTQB Glossary, a **risk** relates to which of the following?

1. Negative feedback to the tester.
1. Negative consequences that will occur.
1. Negative consequences that could occur.
1. Negative consequences for the test object.
    <details><summary>Answer:</summary>3</details></br>

4) Ensuring that test design starts during the requirements definition phase is important to enable which  
of the following test objectives?

1. Preventing defects in the system.
1. Finding defects through dynamic testing.
1. Gaining confidence in the system.
1. Finishing the project on time.
    <details><summary>Answer:</summary>1</details></br>

5) A test team consistently finds between 90% and 95% of the defects present in  
the system under test. While the test manager understands that this is a good defect-detection  
percentage for her test team and industry, senior management and executives remain disappointed  
in the test group, saying that the test team misses too many bugs. Given that the users are generally  
happy with the system and that the failures which have occurred have generally been low impact,  
which of the following testing principles is most likely to help the test manager explain to these  
managers and executives why some defects are likely to be missed?  

1. Exhaustive testing is impossible
1. Defect clustering
1. Pesticide paradox
1. Absence-of-errors fallacy
    <details><summary>Answer:</summary>1</details></br>

6) According to the ISTQB Glossary, regression testing is required for what purpose?

1. To verify the success of corrective actions.
1. To prevent a task from being incorrectly considered completed.
1. To ensure that defects have not been introducedby a modification.
1. To motivate better unit testing by the programmers.
    <details><summary>Answer:</summary>3</details></br>

7) Which of the following is most important to promote and maintain good relationships between
