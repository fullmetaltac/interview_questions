8) Important consequences of the impossibility of complete testing are (Choose one or more answers):
    1. We can never be certain that the program is bug free
    2. We have no definite stopping point for testing, which makes it easier for some managers to argue for very little testing.
    3. We have no easy answer for what testing tasks should always be required, because every task takes time that could be spent on other high importance tasks.
