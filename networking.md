### HTTP(S)

>ðŸ”¹ ***Explain HTTP methods.***

The primary or most-commonly-used `HTTP` methods are `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently. Of those less-frequent methods, `OPTIONS` and `HEAD` are used more often than others.

| HTTP     | CRUD           | Entire Collection (e.g. /users)                                                                        |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`    | Read           | `200` (OK), list of users. Use pagination, sorting and filtering to navigate big lists.                |
| `POST`   | Create         | `201` (Created), Response contains response similar to GET /user/{id} containing new ID.               |
| `PUT`    | Update/Replace | `405` (Method Not Allowed), unless you want to update/replace every resource in the entire collection. |
| `PATCH`  | Update/Modify  | `405` (Method Not Allowed), unless you want to modify the collection itself.                           |
| `DELETE` | Delete         | `405` (Method Not Allowed), unless you want to delete the whole collectionâ€”not often desirable         |

> :bulb: *Status codes:*

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. 

| range     | description                                                                                               |
