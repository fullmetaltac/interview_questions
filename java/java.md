### What is Java. What are features of Java?
Java is a high-level programming language and is platform-independent.

Java is also an object-oriented language. However, everything (except fundamental types) is an object in Java
Platform independent: A single program works on different platforms without any modification.
High Performance: JIT (Just In Time compiler) enables high performance in Java. JIT converts the bytecode into machine language and then JVM starts the execution.
Multi-threaded. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads.
Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through class. It can be achieved by interfaces in java.
Secured: Java is secured because it doesn't use explicit pointers.
Java is a strong programming language as it uses strong memory management. The concepts like Automatic garbage collection.
